### Redis
Whatever platform you choose to deploy to you will need a redis db,
this bot was designed for lightweight db query everything is cached locally to minimize db queries,
that said you can use the same db with different apps only four keys are used that need to be available, i actually use the same db for other things
You will need to add these four keys in your new db,

Key     | Value
--------|-----
usrwall | "{}" 
allwall | "{}" 
usrs    | "{}"
p2pusrs | "{}" 

usrwall  => current wallet address for all users
allwall  => all wallet addresses for all users 
usrs     => all users id
p2pusrs  => users subscribed to p2pool notifications

Bot will fail to start if one of these keys is missing from db
Add them using redis-cli or run the db-setup.py script
